"<think>\nOkay, the user wants two tabletop manipulation tasks for fine-tuning a robot arm with a gripper. The setup includes a white table and general household objects like colored cups, tissue, paper cups, and a permanent marker. Each task needs to involve physical interaction and test skills like planning, perception, or tool use. Let me think about possible tasks.\n\nFirst, maybe something with arranging objects. Like stacking cups? But stacking can be tricky. Maybe using the permanent marker as a tool? Wait, the marker can be used to draw on the cups. But the task needs physical interaction. Alternatively, using the marker to label cups? But that might not test planning. Hmm.\n\nAnother idea: sorting objects based on color. The colored cups and tissue (which might be white or other colors). But the user mentioned colored cups, tissue could be white. Wait, the initial setup is a white table, so maybe the tissue is white. So sorting colored cups into different areas? That would test perception (color recognition) and planning (sorting path). But the gripper needs to pick up and place them. That could be a task. Let me check the required objects. Colored cups and maybe a container for each color. But the user said \"any general household objects,\" so maybe the initial setup has a white table with cups and tissue. Wait, the initial setup is the environment, so maybe the user has to arrange the objects. Wait, the initial setup is what's present. So maybe the initial setup is a white table with colored cups, tissue, paper cups, and a permanent marker. The robot needs to interact with these. \n\nFor task 1: Maybe arranging the cups in a specific order. Like sorting them by color. But how to test perception and planning. Alternatively, using the permanent marker to mark the cups. For example, labeling the cups with different colors. But that requires using the marker as a tool. So the robot would need to pick up the marker, then the cup, then apply the marker to the cup. That involves tool use, planning the sequence, and perception to identify the cup and the marker. That could be a good task. Required objects: colored cups, permanent marker. Initial setup: cups scattered on the table, marker nearby. Difficulty: medium. Because it requires tool use and planning the sequence of actions.\n\nTask 2: Maybe something with the tissue. Like using the tissue to wipe a surface. But the table is white. Alternatively, using the tissue to clean a cup. But the robot would need to pick up the tissue, then the cup, then apply the tissue to the cup. But that's similar to the first task. Alternatively, folding the tissue into a specific shape. But that might be more about manipulation. Or maybe using the tissue to pick up a small object, like a paper cup. Since tissue is flexible, maybe the robot can use it as a tool to grasp a paper cup. That would test perception (identifying the object) and tool use (using tissue as a gripper). So required objects: tissue, paper cups. Initial setup: paper cups and tissue on the table. Difficulty: medium. \n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"practical tabletop manipulation tasks.\" Let me check again. The first task could be using the permanent marker to label cups. The second task could be using the tissue to pick up a paper cup. That would test different skills. Let me structure them properly. \n\nTask 1: Labeling colored cups with the permanent marker. Required objects: colored cups, permanent marker. Initial setup: cups and marker on the table. Difficulty: medium. \n\nTask 2: Using tissue to grasp a paper cup. Required objects: tissue, paper cups. Initial setup: tissue and paper cups on the table. Difficulty: medium. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another task. What about arranging objects in a specific pattern, like placing cups in a line. That tests planning and perception. But that's more about motion planning. But the user wants tasks that test skills like planning, perception, or tool use. So the first task involves tool use (marker), the second involves using the tissue as a tool. That seems good. \n\nI need to make sure each task is distinct and covers different skills. The first task is tool use (using the marker as a tool), the second is using a flexible object as a tool (tissue). That's good. The initial setup for each task would be the objects present. So the initial setup for task 1 is the colored cups and permanent marker on the table. For task 2, tissue and paper cups. \n\nI think that's solid. Now, I need to present them in the required format. Let me check the example again. The user wants each task with description, required_objects, initial_setup, and difficulty. The initial_setup is in ~~. So for task_1, the initial setup would be the cups and marker on the table. \n\nYes, that should work. Let me write them out.\n</think>"
