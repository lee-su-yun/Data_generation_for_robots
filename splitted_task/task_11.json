In the final state, the pink and yellow cups are stacked on top of the white paper cup labeled '3'.

Stack the pink and yellow cups on top of the white paper cup.  ### Planning Reasoning: The task involves stacking the cups, so the robot arm needs to pick up the cups one by one and place them on the designated cup. The white paper cup labeled '3' is the target for stacking, and the pink and yellow cups need to be picked up and placed on it.  ### Step 1 ",
