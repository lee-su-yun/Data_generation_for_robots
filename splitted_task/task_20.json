    "plan": "1. **Pick up the yellow cup** (Step 1): Move the yellow cup to the left side of the table. 2. **Pick up the pink cup** (Step 2): Move the pink cup to the right side of the table. 3. **Move the light blue cup to the top** (Step 3): Place the light blue cup at the top of the triangle.  ### Planning Reasoning: The task requires arranging the cups in a specific triangular formation. The initial arrangement is linear, so we need to move the cups around to form the triangle. The light blue cup needs to be placed at the top, which means it must be moved to the highest position relative to the other two cups.  ### Step-by-Step Annotations:  ",
