## Task:
The task is to move the non-pink cup to the right side of the table, leaving the pink cup in the center.

## Description:
The initial state shows five cups on the table: one pink, two light blue, one white, and one yellow. The pink cup is centered, and the other four cups are scattered around it. In the final state, the pink cup remains in the center, and the non-pink cups are moved to the right side of the table.

## Plan:
The high-level plan for this task is:
1. Identify the non-pink cups.
2. Move the non-pink cups to the right side of the table.
3. Ensure the pink cup stays in the center.

## Reasoning:
The non-pink cups are the light blue, white, and yellow cups. Moving them to the right side of the table will leave the pink cup in the center, fulfilling the task requirements.

## Step 2
[Step 2]
<SUBTASK> Move the white cup to the right side.
<SUBTASK_reason> The white cup is the second non-pink cup to be moved.
<MOVE> Move the white cup to the right side.
<MOVE_reason> The white cup needs to be moved next to ensure all non-pink cups are on the right side.

<SOLUTION> Ensure there's enough space between the white cup and the light blue cup before moving the white cup.

## Step 3
[Step 3]
<SUBTASK> Move the yellow cup to the right side.
<SUBTASK_reason> The yellow cup is the third non-pink cup to be moved.
<MOVE> Move the yellow cup to the right side.
<MOVE_reason> The yellow cup needs to be moved to complete the task.
<ISSUE> The yellow cup might collide with the white cup if they're too close.
<SOLUTION> Ensure there's enough space between the yellow cup and the white cup before moving the yellow cup.

## Step 4
[Step 4]
<SUBTASK> Verify the position of the pink cup.
<SUBTASK_reason> Ensure the pink cup remains in the center.
<MOVE> No movement needed.
