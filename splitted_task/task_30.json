Stack cup 2 on top of cup 1.  ### Planning Reasoning: The task requires stacking the cups in a specific order and position. The initial arrangement of the cups suggests that they need to be moved to the right side of the table before being stacked. The final state indicates that the cups should be stacked in a vertical line, with cup 3 at the bottom. This plan ensures that the cups are moved to the correct location and stacked in the desired order.  ### Step 1 ",
