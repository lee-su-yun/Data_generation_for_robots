<PLAN>:
The task requires moving the white paper cup numbered 3 to the position where the light blue cup is currently located. This involves identifying the target location for the white paper cup and executing a series of movements to achieve the desired placement.

<PLANNING_reason>:
The white paper cup numbered 3 needs to be moved to the position of the light blue cup because it is the target object that needs to be placed in the specified location. The light blue cup is currently in the desired position, so the white paper cup must be moved there to complete the task.

[Step 1]
<SUBTASK>:
Identify the target location for the white paper cup numbered 3.

<SUBTASK_reason>:
To move the white paper cup numbered 3 to the correct position, we need to first identify where it should go. In this case, the target location is the position of the light blue cup.

<MOVE>:
Move the white paper cup numbered 3 to the position of the light blue cup.

<MOVE_reason>:
Moving the white paper cup numbered 3 to the position of the light blue cup is necessary to achieve the task's goal. This involves positioning the white paper cup in the same location as the light blue cup, which is the target location for the task.

<ISSUE>:
There might be a risk of collision if the white paper cup numbered 3 is too large or if the light blue cup is obstructing the path.

<SOLUTION>:
To avoid collision, ensure that the white paper cup numbered 3 is small enough to fit into the space where the light blue cup is located. If the light blue cup is obstructing the path, adjust the robot's movement to avoid any collisions.
