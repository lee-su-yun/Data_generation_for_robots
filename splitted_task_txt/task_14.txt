1. Pick up the light blue plastic cup from the table.
2. Place the light blue plastic cup on the left side of the table.
3. Pick up the purple plastic cup from the table.
4. Place the purple plastic cup on the left side of the table.
5. Pick up the yellow plastic cup from the table.
6. Place the yellow plastic cup on the left side of the table.

### PLANNING_reason:
The plan is structured to sort the cups by type, ensuring that all plastic cups are placed on the left side of the table and all paper cups are placed on the right side of the table. This approach allows for a systematic sorting process, starting with the plastic cups and then moving on to the paper cups.
