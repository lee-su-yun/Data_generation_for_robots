Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 100 realistic tabletop manipulation tasks for a one-armed household robot. Each task needs to involve reasoning, decision-making, or planning. They specified avoiding deformable objects, complex tools, or multi-step assembly. So I need to make sure each task is feasible with current robot hardware and requires some level of reasoning.

First, I should think about the objects available: colored plastic cups, tissues, paper cups, and a permanent marker. The robot can lift and place objects, use visual perception, and localize objects. The tasks must involve meaningful interaction, not just repeating actions.

Let me start by brainstorming different scenarios. For example, sorting objects by color. That would require the robot to recognize colors and decide which cup to pick. But I need to make sure each task is distinct and covers various aspects of reasoning. Maybe tasks involving prioritizing based on distance, avoiding certain objects, or using the marker for labeling.

I need to ensure each task has a clear initial setup and final state. The initial setup should describe positions, colors, orientations, and spatial arrangements. The final state should show the result of the task. Also, difficulty levels: easy, medium, hard. Let me think of different types of reasoning required. For instance, planning the order of actions, considering object properties, or avoiding obstacles.

Wait, the user mentioned avoiding tasks that only involve repetition or precision placement without reasoning. So each task must have a decision point. For example, selecting the right object based on a condition, like picking a red cup over a blue one, or moving an object to a specific location based on its position.

Let me think of some examples. Task 1: Place the red plastic cup next to the blue paper cup. Initial setup: red cup on left, blue paper cup on right. Final state: red cup next to blue paper cup. Difficulty: easy. But maybe that's too simple. Maybe add more complexity. Like, the cups are in different positions, and the robot has to navigate around other objects.

Another idea: Use the marker to label a cup. So the robot needs to find the marker, pick it up, then apply it to the cup. But that requires planning the sequence of actions. However, the marker is a tool, but the user said to avoid complex tool use. Wait, using a marker might be allowed if it's just applying it to a cup. Maybe that's okay.

Let me think of more tasks. Maybe tasks involving stacking, but without multi-step assembly. For example, placing a tissue on top of a cup. But the robot needs to determine the correct position. Or avoiding a tissue that's already on top of another object.

Also, considering object states: upright, tilted, or upside down. For example, a cup that's tilted might need to be straightened before placing another object on it.

I need to ensure variety in the tasks. Let me categorize them: sorting by color, sorting by type, positioning based on proximity, avoiding certain objects, using the marker for labeling, moving objects to specific locations, handling objects in different orientations, etc.

For each task, I need to specify the required objects, initial setup, and final state. Let me start drafting some tasks, making sure they all meet the criteria. I'll need to check that each task requires reasoning and not just mechanical movement. For example, if the robot has to choose between two cups based on color, that's reasoning. If it has to avoid a tissue that's in the way, that's also reasoning.

Also, the initial and final states need to be detailed enough for a human to visualize. So I should mention positions relative to each other, colors, orientations, and any spatial arrangements. For example, a cup on the left side, a tissue in the center, etc.

I need to generate 100 tasks, so I should come up with a list of possible scenarios and then expand them. Let me think of different scenarios and then structure each task accordingly. Let's start with the first few and see the pattern.

Task 1: Place the red plastic cup next to the blue paper cup. Initial setup: red cup on left, blue paper cup on right. Final state: red cup next to blue paper cup. Difficulty: easy. But maybe that's too simple. Maybe add more objects to complicate it.

Wait, the user said "meaningful physical interaction" and "reasoning". So maybe task 1 could be to place the red cup next to the blue cup, but there's a tissue in between. The robot has to move the tissue out of the way first. That would involve reasoning to avoid obstacles.

But the initial setup would need to include that. Let me adjust. Maybe task 1 is to place the red cup next to the blue cup, but the path is blocked by a tissue. The robot needs to move the tissue first. That adds reasoning about path planning.

But the user said to avoid complex tool use. Moving the tissue is allowed, as it's just lifting and placing. So that could be a medium difficulty task.

Alternatively, maybe the initial setup has multiple cups and the robot has to select the correct one based on color. For example, pick the red cup and place it next to the blue cup. That requires color recognition and decision-making.

I think I need to ensure each task has a unique reasoning element. Let me outline some categories:

1. Sorting by color
2. Sorting by type (plastic vs paper)
3. Positioning based on proximity
4. Avoiding obstacles
5. Using the marker for labeling
6. Handling objects in different orientations
7. Prioritizing actions (e.g., move an object first)
8. Stacking or placing on top
9. Clearing a specific area
10. Using object properties (like size, shape)

Each category can have several tasks. Let me start creating tasks under these categories.

For example, under sorting by color:

- Task 1: Place the red cup next to the blue cup.
- Task 2: Move the green tissue to the left of the yellow paper cup.
- Task 3: Stack the blue plastic cup on top of the green tissue.

But I need to make sure each task is detailed. Let me try to write them out with the required format.

I need to generate 100, so I'll need to go through each category and think of variations. Let me make sure that each task is unique and covers different aspects. Also, the difficulty should vary. Some tasks might be easy, others medium or hard based on the complexity of reasoning required.

I should also check that the objects are correctly listed in required_objects, and that the initial and final states are detailed. For example, specifying the positions (left, right, center), colors, orientations (upright, tilted), and any spatial relations (next to, on top of, in front of).

Once I have a list, I can check for repetition and ensure all tasks are distinct. I'll need to be thorough and methodical to cover all 100.
