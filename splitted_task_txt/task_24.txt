**Task**: Place the lavender plastic cup next to the mint plastic cup, ensuring they are not stacked.

**Description**: In the initial image, there are two plastic cups on the table: one mint-colored and one lavender-colored. The mint cup is upright, and the lavender cup is also upright but positioned further away from the mint cup. In the final image, both cups are still present, but their positions have been adjusted so that they are side-by-side and not stacked.

**Plan**: The robot arm needs to pick up the lavender cup, move it to the right, and place it next to the mint cup.

**PLANNING_reason**: The task requires the robot arm to move the lavender cup to the right to ensure it is placed next to the mint cup without stacking. This involves picking up the lavender cup, moving it horizontally, and then placing it back down.

[Step 1]
<SUBTASK> Pick up the lavender plastic cup.
<SUBTASK_reason> The lavender cup needs to be lifted off the table to move it to the right.
<MOVE> Move the gripper towards the lavender cup and close it around the cup.
<MOVE_reason> Closing the gripper around the lavender cup allows for a secure grip before lifting it.
<ISSUE> The gripper might accidentally grab the mint cup if it's too close.
<SOLUTION> Ensure the gripper is positioned correctly over the lavender cup before closing it.

[Step 2]
<SUBTASK> Move the lavender plastic cup to the right.
<SUBTASK_reason> Moving the lavender cup to the right ensures it is placed next to the mint cup without stacking.
<MOVE> Move the gripper to the right, keeping the lavender cup in the gripper.
<MOVE_reason> Moving the gripper to the right allows the lavender cup to be placed next to the mint cup.
<ISSUE> The gripper might collide with the mint cup if it's too close.
<SOLUTION> Adjust the gripper's position to avoid colliding with the mint cup during the movement.

[Step 3]
<SUBTASK> Place the lavender plastic cup next to the mint plastic cup.
<SUBTASK_reason> Placing the lavender cup next to the mint cup completes the task requirement.
<MOVE> Open the gripper and release the lavender cup onto the table.
<MOVE_reason> Releasing the lavender cup allows it to be placed next to the mint cup.
<ISSUE> The lavender cup might fall off the table if the gripper is not closed properly.
