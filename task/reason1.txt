Okay, so I need to come up with 100 realistic tabletop manipulation tasks for a 1-armed household robot. Each task needs to involve meaningful physical interaction and require reasoning, decision-making, or planning. Let me start by breaking down the requirements.

First, the robot has a gripper and can handle objects like plastic cups, tissues, paper cups, and a permanent marker. It can lift and place objects. The tasks must not involve deformable objects, complex tools, or multi-step assembly. So, I need to focus on tasks that require the robot to make decisions based on object properties, positions, or constraints.

Let me think about possible scenarios. For example, the robot might need to sort objects by color, arrange them in a certain order, or use one object to manipulate another. Each task should have a clear initial setup and required objects. The difficulty levels should vary from easy to hard.

Starting with task 1: Maybe sorting objects by color. Like, place all red objects in one area and blue in another. That requires the robot to recognize colors and decide where to place each object. That's medium difficulty.

Task 2: Maybe arranging objects in a specific order, like stacking cups in order of size. The robot needs to identify sizes and decide the order. That's medium.

Task 3: Using the marker to label an object. The robot has to pick up the marker, then the object, and apply the marker. But how? Maybe the marker is used to draw on the object. Wait, but the robot can't write, so maybe it's just placing the marker near the object? Or maybe using the marker to mark the object's position? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, the robot could use the marker to indicate a specific object, like placing it next to the object. Maybe that's a task. But I need to think of tasks that involve reasoning.

Wait, the example given in the problem is selecting the right item based on a condition. So maybe tasks like "Pick up the red cup and place it next to the blue cup." That requires recognizing colors and positioning. That's a possible task.

Another idea: Avoiding specific objects. Like, pick up all cups except the green one. That requires the robot to recognize the green cup and not pick it up. That's a reasoning task.

Or, prioritizing actions. For example, if there are multiple cups, pick up the one that's closest to the marker. That involves distance calculation and decision-making.

I need to make sure each task is feasible with current hardware. So, tasks that don't require precise force control or complex movements. Also, the robot can manipulate common objects, so tasks involving stacking, moving, sorting, arranging, etc.

Let me list some possible categories:

1. Sorting by color, shape, or type.
2. Arranging in order (size, position, etc.).
3. Using one object to manipulate another (e.g., using a cup to move a tissue).
4. Avoiding certain objects based on properties.
5. Prioritizing based on distance, position, or other factors.
6. Sequencing actions (e.g., pick up A then B, but in a certain order).
7. Using a tool (like the marker) to mark or indicate something.
8. Combining objects in a specific way (e.g., stacking two cups on top of a tissue).
9. Placing objects in specific locations relative to other objects.
10. Handling objects that require careful placement (e.g., not dropping them).

Each of these can be turned into tasks. Now, I need to ensure that each task has required objects, initial setup, and difficulty. Let me try to outline some tasks.

For example:

task_1: Sort red and blue cups into separate bins.
required_objects: red cup, blue cup, two bins.
initial_setup: cups are scattered on the table.
difficulty: medium.

But maybe the bins aren't part of the initial setup. Wait, the initial setup should be the objects on the table. So maybe the bins are part of the table setup. Or maybe the robot has to create a sorting area. Hmm, perhaps the initial setup includes the objects and the target areas. But the problem says the initial setup is the objects on the table. Maybe the bins are on the table as well. So the initial setup would be the cups and bins on the table.

But the user might not have bins. Maybe the task is to arrange the cups in specific positions on the table. For example, place all red cups on the left and blue on the right. That way, the required objects are the cups, and the initial setup is the cups scattered. Then the robot needs to sort them based on color.

Another task: Arrange cups in order of size. The robot needs to pick up the smallest, then medium, then largest, placing them in a line. That requires identifying sizes and ordering them. Difficulty: medium.

Task involving using the marker: Place the marker next to the tissue so it's visible. The robot has to decide where to place the marker relative to the tissue. Maybe that's too simple. Alternatively, use the marker to draw a line on the table. But the robot can't write, so maybe that's not feasible. Hmm.

Alternatively, the robot could use the marker to indicate a target area. For example, the task is to place the marker on a specific spot, and then use it to guide the placement of another object. But that might be more complex.

Another idea: The robot needs to pick up an object that's not covered by another. For example, if a tissue is on top of a cup, the robot must first move the tissue to pick up the cup. That requires reasoning about object stacking. Difficulty: medium.

Or, the robot has to avoid picking up an object that's fragile. For example, the task is to pick up all cups except the paper cup, which is fragile. That requires recognizing the type of cup and making a decision. Difficulty: medium.

I need to ensure that each task requires reasoning. Let me think of 100 tasks. Maybe start with sorting tasks, then arranging, then using objects to manipulate others, avoiding certain objects, prioritizing, etc.

Let me try to list them in categories:

Sorting by color, shape, type.
Arranging in order.
Avoiding certain objects.
Prioritizing based on distance, position.
Using one object to move another.
Handling fragile objects.
Sequencing actions.
Placing objects in relation to others.
Using the marker for indication.
Combining objects in specific ways.
Handling multiple objects with constraints.
Identifying objects based on properties.
Avoiding collisions.
Ensuring stability (e.g., stacking without tipping).
Selecting the correct object based on a condition.
Handling objects that are in specific positions.
Etc.

Now, I need to make sure each task is unique and covers different aspects of reasoning. Let me start drafting them one by one, ensuring they are realistic and require decision-making.

Task 1: Sort red and blue cups into two designated areas on the table. Required objects: red cup, blue cup. Initial setup: cups are scattered. Difficulty: medium.

Task 2: Arrange cups in order of size (smallest to largest) in a line. Required objects: three cups of varying sizes. Initial setup: cups are scattered. Difficulty: medium.

Task 3: Pick up the cup that is not covered by any other object. Required objects: cup, tissue, paper cup. Initial setup: tissue is on top of the cup, paper cup is on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 4: Place the marker next to the tissue so it's clearly visible. Required objects: marker, tissue. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: easy.

Task 5: Avoid picking up the green cup; instead, pick up the red cup. Required objects: green cup, red cup. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: easy.

Task 6: Place the tissue in a position where it's not touching any other object. Required objects: tissue, cup. Initial setup: tissue and cup are on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 7: Stack the cups in a way that the smallest cup is on top. Required objects: three cups of different sizes. Initial setup: cups are scattered. Difficulty: medium.

Task 8: Pick up the cup that is farthest from the marker. Required objects: cup, marker. Initial setup: cup and marker are on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 9: Place the paper cup in a spot where it's not overlapping with the plastic cup. Required objects: paper cup, plastic cup. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 10: Use the marker to indicate the location of the tissue. Required objects: marker, tissue. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Wait, but the marker is a tool, but the robot can't write. So maybe using the marker to point to the tissue. Like placing the marker near the tissue. That could be a task.

Continuing this way, I need to make sure each task is unique and covers different aspects. Let me think of more tasks, ensuring that each requires reasoning.

Task 11: Place the cup so that it's touching the edge of the table. Required objects: cup. Initial setup: cup on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 12: Pick up the cup that is not in the center of the table. Required objects: cup. Initial setup: cup is on the edge. Difficulty: easy.

Task 13: Arrange the cups in a triangle formation. Required objects: three cups. Initial setup: cups scattered. Difficulty: hard.

Task 14: Place the tissue on top of the cup without causing it to tip over. Required objects: tissue, cup. Initial setup: cup on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 15: Select the cup that is closest to the marker and place it in the center. Required objects: cup, marker. Initial setup: cup and marker on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 16: Avoid placing the tissue on top of the cup; instead, place it next to the cup. Required objects: tissue, cup. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 17: Stack the cups so that the largest is at the bottom. Required objects: three cups. Initial setup: cups scattered. Difficulty: medium.

Task 18: Use the marker to mark the position of the tissue. Required objects: marker, tissue. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 19: Place the paper cup in a position where it's not directly under the plastic cup. Required objects: paper cup, plastic cup. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 20: Pick up the cup that is not adjacent to any other object. Required objects: cup, tissue, paper cup. Initial setup: tissue and paper cup are on the table. Difficulty: medium.

This is getting lengthy. I need to continue this process, ensuring that each task is unique and requires reasoning. Let me think of other possible tasks.

Task 21: Arrange the cups in a line with equal spacing between them. Required objects: three cups. Initial setup: cups scattered. Difficulty: hard.

Task 22: Place the tissue in a spot where it's not overlapping with any other object. Required objects: tissue, cup. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 23: Select the cup that is the same color as the marker. Required objects: cup, marker. Initial setup: cup and marker on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 24: Avoid placing the cup on top of the tissue; instead, place it next to the tissue. Required objects: cup, tissue. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 25: Use the marker to indicate the correct position for the cup. Required objects: marker, cup. Initial setup: cup and marker on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 26: Place the paper cup in a spot where it's not touching the edge of the table. Required objects: paper cup. Initial setup: paper cup on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 27: Pick up the cup that is not in the same row as the marker. Required objects: cup, marker. Initial setup: cup and marker on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 28: Arrange the cups in a circle formation. Required objects: three cups. Initial setup: cups scattered. Difficulty: hard.

Task 29: Place the tissue on the cup so that it's centered. Required objects: tissue, cup. Initial setup: cup on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Task 30: Select the cup that is the same size as the plastic cup. Required objects: cup, plastic cup. Initial setup: both on the table. Difficulty: medium.

Continuing this way, I can create 100 tasks. Each task should have a unique scenario, requiring the robot to make decisions based on object properties, positions, or constraints. I need to ensure that tasks don't repeat the same reasoning aspects and cover different aspects like color, size, position, avoiding certain objects, using tools (marker), etc.

I need to check for variety in the tasks. For example, some tasks could involve avoiding specific objects, others might require ordering, some might involve spatial reasoning (like arranging in a line or circle), others might involve using a tool to indicate something.

Also, difficulty levels should be balanced. Some tasks are easy (like picking up an object not covered by another), some medium (like sorting by color), and some hard (like arranging in a specific formation).

I think I can continue this process, ensuring that each task is distinct and meets the requirements. Let me try to list the remaining tasks, making sure they are all unique and require reasoning.
