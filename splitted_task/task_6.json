    "plan": "1. Identify the cup that is upside down. 2. Move the upside-down cup to the right side of the table. 3. Move the remaining four cups to the right side of the table.  ### Planning Reasoning: The task requires moving all the cups to the right side of the table. The first step is to identify the cup that is upside down, which is crucial for the subsequent steps. Once identified, the cup can be moved to the right side of the table. Then, the remaining four cups need to be moved to the right side of the table.  ### Step-by-Step Plan: 1. Identify the cup that is upside down. 2. Move the upside-down cup to the right side of the table. 3. Move the remaining four cups to the right side of the table.  ### Step 1: Identify the cup that is upside down. The cup that is upside down is the white cup located in the center-left of the table.  ### Step 2: Move the upside-down cup to the right side of the table. The robot arm should move the white cup to the right side of the table. This involves picking up the white cup and placing it on the right side of the table.  ### Step 3: Move the remaining four cups to the right side of the table. After moving the white cup to the right side of the table, the robot arm should pick up the remaining four cups and place them on the right side of the table.  ### Step 4: Verify the final state. Once all the cups are moved to the right side of the table, the task is complete.  ",
