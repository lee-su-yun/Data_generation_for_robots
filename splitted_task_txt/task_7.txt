### Task:
Stack the white plastic cups on top of each other in the center of the table.

### Description:
The initial state shows three white plastic cups placed on the table, with one cup flipped upside down. The final state shows two cups stacked on top of each other in the center of the table. The task requires the robot arm to pick up the flipped cup and stack it on top of the other two cups.

### Plan:
1. Pick up the flipped cup from the table.
2. Move the cup to the center of the table.
3. Stack the cup on top of the other two cups.

### PLANNING_reason:
The task involves stacking the cups, which requires picking up the flipped cup and placing it on top of the other two cups. The initial state shows the flipped cup, so the first step is to pick it up. The second step is to move the cup to the center of the table, ensuring that the final position is correct for stacking. The third step is to stack the cup on top of the other two cups, completing the task.

### Step 1
[Step 1]
<SUBTASK> Pick up the flipped cup from the table.
<SUBTASK_reason> The flipped cup needs to be picked up before it can be stacked on top of the other two cups.
<MOVE> Move the gripper towards the flipped cup and close it to pick it up.
<MOVE_reason> The gripper needs to be positioned over the flipped cup to pick it up.
<ISSUE> The gripper might collide with the table if it's too close.
<SOLUTION> Adjust the gripper's position slightly away from the table to avoid collision.

### Step 2
[Step 2]
<SUBTASK> Move the cup to the center of the table.
<SUBTASK_reason> The cup needs to be positioned correctly in the center of the table before it can be stacked.
<MOVE> Move the gripper towards the center of the table and place the cup down.
<MOVE_reason> The gripper needs to be positioned over the center of the table to place the cup correctly.
<ISSUE> The gripper might collide with the table if it's too close.
<SOLUTION> Adjust the gripper's position slightly away from the table to avoid collision.

### Step 3
[Step 3]
<SUBTASK> Stack the cup on top of the other two cups.
<SUBTASK_reason> The cup needs to be stacked on top of the other two cups to complete the task.
<MOVE> Move the gripper towards the other two cups and close it to stack the cup on top of them.
<MOVE_reason> The gripper needs to be positioned over the other two cups to stack the cup correctly.
<ISSUE> The gripper might collide with the other cups if it's too close.
<SOLUTION> Adjust the gripper's position slightly away from the other cups to avoid collision.
