## Task:
The task is to move the yellow plastic cup to the left side of the table, ensuring it remains upright.

## Description:
The initial state shows four plastic cups on a table: one yellow, one pink, one purple, and one light blue. The yellow cup is initially positioned on the right side of the table. In the final state, the yellow cup is moved to the left side of the table, and all cups appear to be upright.

## Plan:
1. Identify the yellow cup.
2. Check if the yellow cup is upright.
3. If the yellow cup is upright, move it to the left side of the table.

## PLANNING_reason:
The plan is structured to ensure the yellow cup is moved only if it is upright, as moving an inverted cup could cause it to tip over or spill its contents.

## Step 1
[Step 1]
<SUBTASK> Identify the yellow plastic cup.
<SUBTASK_reason> The first step is to locate the yellow cup among the other cups.
<MOVE> Look for the yellow cup in the top view.
<MOVE_reason> The top view provides a clear perspective of the entire table and helps identify the yellow cup's position.
<ISSUE> The yellow cup might be obscured by other cups or the camera angle might not show it clearly.
<SOLUTION> Ensure the camera angle is adjusted to clearly see the yellow cup before proceeding.

## Step 2
[Step 2]
<SUBTASK> Check if the yellow plastic cup is upright.
<SUBTASK_reason> It's important to verify the cup's orientation to prevent any accidents during the move.
<MOVE> Check the exo-wrist view to confirm the yellow cup is upright.
<MOVE_reason> The exo-wrist view provides a close-up of the yellow cup, allowing for a precise check of its orientation.
<ISSUE> The yellow cup might be inverted, causing it to tip over or spill its contents.
<SOLUTION> If the yellow cup is inverted, place it back upright before moving it.

## Step 3
[Step 3]
<SUBTASK> Move the yellow plastic cup to the left side of the table.
<SUBTASK_reason> Once confirmed as upright, the yellow cup can be moved to the desired location.
<MOVE> Move the yellow cup to the left side of the table.
<MOVE_reason> This primitive movement involves adjusting the robot arm's position to place the yellow cup on the left side of the table.
<ISSUE> The yellow cup might collide with other cups or the table edge during the move.
<SOLUTION> Adjust the robot arm's speed and trajectory to avoid collisions.
