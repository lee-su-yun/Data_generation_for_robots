Stack the cup on top of the other two cups.  ### Planning Reasoning: The task involves stacking the cups, which means the robot needs to pick up one cup and place it on top of the others. The initial image shows the flipped cup, so the robot must first identify and pick it up before moving it to the center of the table for stacking.  ### Step 1 ",
