### Task:
The task is to sort all cups by color, placing each color in a specific quadrant of the table.

### Description:
In the initial image, there are multiple colored plastic cups scattered across the table. In the final image, the cups are sorted into four quadrants based on their color. The cups are light blue, white, pink, and yellow.

### Plan:
1. **Step 1:** Identify the light blue cups and place them in the top-left quadrant.
2. **Step 2:** Identify the white cups and place them in the top-right quadrant.
3. **Step 3:** Identify the pink cups and place them in the bottom-left quadrant.
4. **Step 4:** Identify the yellow cups and place them in the bottom-right quadrant.

### PLANNING_reason:
The task requires sorting the cups by color and placing them in specific quadrants. The initial image shows the cups scattered, while the final image shows them organized. By identifying the cups in the initial image and placing them in the corresponding quadrants in the final image, we can achieve the desired outcome.

### [Step 1]
**SUBTASK:** Identify the light blue cups and place them in the top-left quadrant.
**SUBTASK_reason:** The light blue cups need to be separated from the other colors to start organizing the cups by color.
**MOVE:** Move the light blue cups to the top-left quadrant.
**MOVE_reason:** This move is necessary to begin the sorting process and separate the light blue cups from the rest.
**ISSUE:** Potential issue: The gripper might collide with other cups if they are too close together.
**SOLUTION:** Ensure the gripper moves slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.

### [Step 2]
**SUBTASK:** Identify the white cups and place them in the top-right quadrant.
**SUBTASK_reason:** The white cups need to be separated from the other colors to continue organizing the cups by color.
**MOVE:** Move the white cups to the top-right quadrant.
**MOVE_reason:** This move is necessary to separate the white cups from the remaining colors.
**ISSUE:** Potential issue: The gripper might collide with other cups if they are too close together.
**SOLUTION:** Ensure the gripper moves slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.

### [Step 3]
**SUBTASK:** Identify the pink cups and place them in the bottom-left quadrant.
**SUBTASK_reason:** The pink cups need to be separated from the other colors to continue organizing the cups by color.
**MOVE:** Move the pink cups to the bottom-left quadrant.
**MOVE_reason:** This move is necessary to separate the pink cups from the remaining colors.
**ISSUE:** Potential issue: The gripper might collide with other cups if they are too close together.
**SOLUTION:** Ensure the gripper moves slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.

### [Step 4]
**SUBTASK:** Identify the yellow cups and place them in the bottom-right quadrant.
**SUBTASK_reason:** The yellow cups need to be separated from the other colors to complete the organization.
**MOVE:** Move the yellow cups to the bottom-right quadrant.
**MOVE_reason:** This move is necessary to separate the yellow cups from the remaining colors.
**ISSUE:** Potential issue: The gripper might collide with other cups if they are too close together.
**SOLUTION:** Ensure the gripper moves slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.
