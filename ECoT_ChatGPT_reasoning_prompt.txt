### Optimized Prompt:

# Objective:
You are tasked with annotating a trajectory of a robot arm performing a task. After receiveing the task and the environmental details, you must provide detailed reasoning that justifies the action to take, based on the task and environment (image).

# Experimental Setup:
- You are an expert reinforcement learning researcher. A robotic arm has been trained to complete a task which will be provided below.
- Also, two kinds of images are going to be given: One is taken from the ego camera which is located at the top of the environment. Another one is taken from the exo camera which is attatched to the wrist of the robot arm gripper.
- The arm executes a series of actions. You have to generate sequence of steps the robot will take to complete the task, and your goal is to provide a reasoning for each of these steps.

# Instructions for Annotating the Trajectory:
Begin by describing the task:
Start by giving an overview of the task. Make it more comprehensive than the simple instruction. Include the activity, the objects the robotic arm interacts with, and their relative locations in the environment. Then, describe the high-level movements that were most likely executed, based on the task that was completed and the primitive movements that were executed. Then, for each high-level movement write the interval of steps that movement consists of. Also, for each high-level movement write a justification for why it should be executed. Write an answer for this part using markdown and natural language. Be descriptive and highlight all the relevant details.

For each step of the trajectory, you must:
- Describe the full task that remains to be completed (but only describe what remains), and place it inside a tag <task>.
- Describe the complete high-level plan for completing the remaining task (the list of remaining high-level steps), and place it inside a tag <plan>.
- Describe the high-level step that should be executed now (chosen from the list of high-level steps), and place it inside a tag <subtask>.
- Describe why the chosen high-level step should be executed now, which features of the current environment influence that decision, and how it should be done. Place it within a tag <subtask_reason>.
- Describe the current primitive movement of the arm that needs to be executed, and place it inside a tag <move>.
- Describe why the chosen movement should be executed now and which features of the current environment influence that decision. Place it inside a tag <move_reason>.
- Number each step. Also, change the line of every item(task, plan, subtask, etc) for readability.

# Example Format for One Step:
[Step 1]
<TASK> Put the grey sponge on the yellow towel.
<PLAN> Move to the sponge, pick up the sponge, move to the towel, put down the sponge.
<SUBTASK> The sponge is on the table, and it needs to be reached first Move to the sponge.
<SUBTASK_reason> 
<MOVE> The sponge is below the robot, so move down -> 'Move down'
<MOVE_reason> 

# Final Label:
Once all steps have been annotated with reasoning, end the response with a label:
FINISHED

# TASK
: Align the cup horizontally with number in ascending order. Small number should be moved at the right side of the table. The cup might be flipped over or overlapped with other cup.


#### Scene Description:
The robot arm is in an environment with the following objects: Three white cups labeled 1, 2, 3 at the top is on a white table.
The scene usually shows a black robot arm gripper with a silver camera attached.
