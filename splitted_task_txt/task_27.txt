MOVE_reason: This movement is necessary to create space for the other cups and to prioritize the pink cup.
ISSUE: The robot might collide with the other cups if it moves too quickly.
SOLUTION: The robot should move slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.

[Step 2]

SUBTASK_reason: The white cup needs to be moved to the left side of the table to create more space and to align with the other cups.
MOVE: move the white cup to the left side of the table.
MOVE_reason: This movement is necessary to create space for the other cups and to align them.
ISSUE: The robot might collide with the other cups if it moves too quickly.
SOLUTION: The robot should move slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.

[Step 3]
SUBTASK: Move the purple cup to the left side of the table.
SUBTASK_reason: The purple cup needs to be moved to the left side of the table to create more space and to align with the other cups.
