Stack cup 2 on top of cup 3.  ### Planning Reasoning: The task involves stacking the cups in alternating layers. The initial state shows the cups arranged in a row, which makes it easy to identify the order for stacking. The final state shows the cups stacked in the desired pattern, so we can infer the steps needed to achieve this.  ### Step 1 ",
