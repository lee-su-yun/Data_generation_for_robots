2. Move the paper cup labeled 1 to the left side of the table.
3. Pick up the plastic cup.
4. Move the plastic cup to the left side of the table.

10. Stack the paper cup labeled 2 on top of the plastic cup.
11. Pick up the paper cup labeled 3.
12. Move the paper cup labeled 3 to the left side of the table.
13. Pick up the plastic cup.
14. Move the plastic cup to the left side of the table.
15. Stack the paper cup labeled 3 on top of the plastic cup.

### PLANNING_reason:
The plan is structured to ensure that the cups are stacked in alternating layers, starting with a paper cup and ending with a paper cup. This is achieved by picking up each cup in order and moving it to the left side of the table before stacking it on top of the previous cup.

### [Step 1]
<SUBTASK> Pick up the paper cup labeled 1.
<SUBTASK_reason> The paper cup labeled 1 needs to be picked up to start the stacking process.
<MOVE> Move the gripper towards the paper cup labeled 1 and pick it up.
<MOVE_reason> The gripper needs to reach the paper cup labeled 1 to pick it up.
<ISSUE> The gripper may collide with other objects if it moves too close to them.

<MOVE_reason> The gripper needs to move the paper cup labeled 1 to the left side of the table.
<ISSUE> The gripper may drop the paper cup labeled 1 if it moves too quickly.
<SOLUTION> Move the gripper slowly and steadily to ensure the paper cup labeled 1 is placed correctly.

### [Step 3]
<SUBTASK> Pick up the plastic cup.
<SUBTASK_reason> The plastic cup needs to be picked up to continue the stacking process.
<MOVE> Move the gripper towards the plastic cup and pick it up.
<MOVE_reason> The gripper needs to reach the plastic cup to pick it up.
<ISSUE> The gripper may collide with other objects if it moves too close to them.
<SOLUTION> Ensure the gripper moves slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.

### [Step 4]
<SUBTASK> Move the plastic cup to the left side of the table.
<SUBTASK_reason> The plastic cup needs to be moved to the left side of the table to continue the stacking process.
<MOVE> Move the gripper to the left side of the table and place the plastic cup on the table.
<MOVE_reason> The gripper needs to move the plastic cup to the left side of the table.
<ISSUE> The gripper may drop the plastic cup if it moves too quickly.
<SOLUTION> Move the gripper slowly and steadily to ensure the plastic cup is placed correctly.

### [Step 5]
<SUBTASK> Stack the paper cup labeled 1 on top of the plastic cup.
<SUBTASK_reason> The paper cup labeled 1 needs to be stacked on top of the plastic cup to continue the stacking process.
<MOVE> Move the gripper towards the plastic cup and place the paper cup labeled 1 on top of it.
<MOVE_reason> The gripper needs to reach the plastic cup to stack the paper cup labeled 1 on top of it.
