### Task:
Arrange the cups in a line from left to right by color, starting with light blue.

### Description:
The initial state shows multiple cups scattered on a table. The final state requires the cups to be arranged in a specific order: light blue, white, white, white, and pink. The cups are currently not aligned in any particular order, and some are stacked.

### Plan:
1. Pick up the light blue cup from the leftmost position.
2. Place the light blue cup in the first position on the table.
3. Pick up the first white cup from the second position.
4. Place the first white cup in the second position.
5. Pick up the second white cup from the third position.
6. Place the second white cup in the third position.
7. Pick up the third white cup from the fourth position.
8. Place the third white cup in the fourth position.
9. Pick up the pink cup from the fifth position.
10. Place the pink cup in the fifth position.

### PLANNING_reason:
The plan starts with picking up the light blue cup because it is the first color in the desired arrangement. Then, the remaining cups are picked up and placed in their respective positions in order to achieve the final arrangement.

### [Step 1]
<SUBTASK> Pick up the light blue cup from the leftmost position.
<SUBTASK_reason> The light blue cup needs to be moved to the first position to start the arrangement.
<MOVE> Move to the light blue cup, pick it up, and move it to the first position.
<MOVE_reason> This primitive movement is necessary to pick up the light blue cup and place it in the correct position.
<ISSUE> Potential issue: The gripper might collide with other cups if they are too close together.
<SOLUTION> Ensure there is enough space between the cups before attempting to pick them up.

### [Step 2]
<SUBTASK> Place the light blue cup in the first position.
<SUBTASK_reason> The light blue cup needs to be positioned correctly to start the arrangement.
<MOVE> Move the gripper to the first position and release the light blue cup.
<MOVE_reason> This primitive movement is necessary to place the light blue cup in the correct position.
<ISSUE> Potential issue: The gripper might not be able to reach the first position due to obstructions.
<SOLUTION> Adjust the gripper's position to ensure it can reach the first position.

### [Step 3]
<SUBTASK> Pick up the first white cup from the second position.
<SUBTASK_reason> The first white cup needs to be moved to the second position to continue the arrangement.
<MOVE> Move to the first white cup, pick it up, and move it to the second position.
<MOVE_reason> This primitive movement is necessary to pick up the first white cup and place it in the correct position.
<ISSUE> Potential issue: The gripper might collide with other cups if they are too close together.
<SOLUTION> Ensure there is enough space between the cups before attempting to pick them up.

### [Step 4]
<SUBTASK> Place the first white cup in the second position.
<SUBTASK_reason> The first white cup needs to be positioned correctly to continue the arrangement.
<MOVE> Move the gripper to the second position and release the first white cup.
<MOVE_reason> This primitive movement is necessary to place the first white cup in the correct position.
<ISSUE> Potential issue: The gripper might not be able to reach the second position due to obstructions.
<SOLUTION> Adjust the gripper's position to ensure it can reach the second position.

### [Step 5]
<SUBTASK> Pick up the second white cup from the third position.
<SUBTASK_reason> The second white cup needs to be moved to the third position to continue the arrangement.
<MOVE> Move to the second white cup, pick it up, and move it to the third position.
<MOVE_reason> This primitive movement is necessary to pick up the second white cup and place it in the correct position.
<ISSUE> Potential issue: The gripper might collide with other cups if they are too close together.
<SOLUTION> Ensure there is enough space between the cups before attempting to pick them up.

### [Step 6]
<SUBTASK> Place the second white cup in the third position.
<SUBTASK_reason> The second white cup needs to be positioned correctly to continue the arrangement.
<MOVE> Move the gripper to the third position and release the second white cup.
<MOVE_reason> This primitive movement is necessary to place the second white cup in the correct position.
<ISSUE> Potential issue: The gripper might not be able to reach the third position due to obstructions.
<SOLUTION> Adjust the gripper's position to ensure it can reach the third position.

### [Step 7]
<SUBTASK> Pick up the third white cup from the fourth position.
