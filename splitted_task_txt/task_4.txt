### Task:
The task is to place the yellow plastic cup next to the blue plastic cup, ensuring it is not on top of any other cup.

### Description:
The initial state shows four plastic cups on a table: a yellow cup, a blue cup, a white cup, and a purple cup. The final state shows the yellow cup placed next to the blue cup, with no other cups overlapping them.

### Plan:
1. **Step 1:** Identify the yellow cup and the blue cup.
2. **Step 2:** Move the yellow cup to the left of the blue cup.
3. **Step 3:** Ensure the yellow cup is not on top of any other cup.

### Reasoning:
The task requires placing the yellow cup next to the blue cup without overlapping any other cups. The initial and final states show the yellow cup being moved to the left of the blue cup, fulfilling the task requirements.
