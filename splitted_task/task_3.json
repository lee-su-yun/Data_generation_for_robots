    "plan": "1. **Step 1:** Move the yellow cup to the right side of the table. 2. **Step 2:** Move the pink cup to the right side of the table. 3. **Step 3:** Move the purple cup to the right side of the table. 4. **Step 4:** Move the blue cup to the right side of the table.  ### Planning Reasoning: The task requires moving all non-white cups to the right side of the table. The white cups are not part of the task, so they remain stationary. By moving the non-white cups to the right, we achieve the desired final state where all cups are aligned on the right side of the table.  ### Step-by-Step Execution:  ",
