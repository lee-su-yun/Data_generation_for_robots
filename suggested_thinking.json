"<think>\nOkay, the user wants five practical tabletop manipulation tasks for fine-tuning a foundation model for robotics. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The robot has a gripper and can interact with household objects like colored cups, tissue, paper cups, and a permanent marker. The tasks need to involve physical interaction and test skills like planning, perception, or tool use. Each task should have a description, required objects, initial setup, and difficulty level.\n\nFirst, I need to think of tasks that are common in household settings and require different skills. Let me brainstorm some ideas. Maybe starting with something simple like stacking objects. But stacking might be too basic. What about arranging objects in a specific order? Wait, the user mentioned planning and perception. Maybe a task that requires the robot to sort objects based on color or shape. That would test perception and planning.\n\nAnother idea: using a tool, like the permanent marker, to mark an object. That would involve tool use. For example, marking a cup with a label. But how to set that up? The initial setup would have the marker and the cup. The robot needs to pick up the marker, then the cup, and then apply the marker. That's a good task for tool use and planning.\n\nWhat about a task that involves multiple steps? Like using a tissue to clean a cup. The robot would need to pick up the tissue, then the cup, maybe wet the tissue, and then wipe the cup. But the initial setup might need a water source, which the user didn't mention. Maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, using a tissue to wipe a surface. But the user said \"white table,\" maybe the task is to wipe a stain. Hmm, but the objects available are tissue, paper cups, etc. Maybe using a tissue to clean a cup, but without water. The robot would need to pick up the tissue, then the cup, and then press the tissue against the cup. That could work. It tests grasping and tool use.\n\nAnother task could be assembling a structure, like stacking cups. But that's similar to the first idea. Maybe a more complex stacking, like balancing a cup on top of another. That would require perception to judge balance and planning to execute the stacking.\n\nWhat about a task that involves measuring or transferring? For example, using a cup to transfer liquid from one container to another. But the user didn't mention liquid containers. Wait, the objects are tissue, paper cups, permanent marker. Maybe using a paper cup to hold something. Or maybe using the marker to draw on a cup, which requires precision. That's similar to the earlier idea.\n\nLet me list possible tasks:\n\n1. Sorting objects by color using the gripper. Required objects: colored cups. Initial setup: scattered on the table. Difficulty: medium. Needs perception to identify colors and planning to sort.\n\n2. Using the permanent marker to label a cup. Required objects: cup, marker. Initial setup: marker and cup on the table. Difficulty: medium. Tests tool use and precision.\n\n3. Assembling a stack of cups. Required: multiple cups. Initial: cups scattered. Difficulty: medium. Needs planning and grasping.\n\n4. Wiping a surface with a tissue. Required: tissue, cup. Initial: tissue and cup on table. Difficulty: easy. Tests grasping and tool use.\n\n5. Using a paper cup to hold an object. Required: paper cup, tissue. Initial: tissue and cup on table. Difficulty: easy. Tests grasping and object manipulation.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned \"general household objects\" like colored cups, tissue, paper cups, permanent marker. So the fifth task could involve using the paper cup to hold something, but maybe the initial setup is the cup and tissue. But the task would be to place the tissue inside the cup. That's a simple task, but maybe not as challenging.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a task that requires the robot to use the marker to draw a line on a surface, which would test precision and tool use. But that might be similar to the second task.\n\nI need to ensure each task tests different skills. Let me check the skills: planning, perception, tool use. Let me adjust:\n\nTask 1: Sorting by color (perception, planning)\nTask 2: Using marker to label (tool use, precision)\nTask 3: Stacking cups (planning, grasping)\nTask 4: Wiping a cup with tissue (tool use, grasping)\nTask 5: Assembling a structure with cups (planning, perception)\n\nWait, maybe the fifth task could be something like using the marker to draw on the cup, but that's similar to task 2. Alternatively, maybe using the tissue to clean a cup, which is similar to task 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a task that requires the robot to open a container. But the objects given don't include containers. The user said \"general household objects,\" so maybe the tissue can be used to open something? Not sure. Alternatively, using the permanent marker to write on a surface, which is task 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a task where the robot has to pick up a paper cup, then use the tissue to wipe it, then place it back. That could test multiple steps and tool use. But that might be combining tasks.\n\nLet me finalize the five tasks:\n\n1. Sorting colored cups by color (perception, planning)\n2. Labeling a cup with a permanent marker (tool use, precision)\n3. Stacking cups in a specific order (planning, grasping)\n4. Wiping a cup with a tissue (tool use, grasping)\n5. Assembling a structure with cups and tissue (planning, perception)\n\nWait, but the fifth task might need more detail. Let me think again. Maybe a task where the robot has to use the tissue to clean a surface, like the table, but that's similar to task 4. Alternatively, using the tissue to wipe a cup, which is task 4. \n\nAlternatively, a task that involves using the marker to draw a line on the table, which requires precise motion planning. That's another tool use task. But maybe that's redundant with task 2.\n\nI think the initial list of five is okay. Now, I need to structure each task with description, required objects, initial setup, and difficulty. Let me check each one again for clarity and skill testing.\n</think>"
