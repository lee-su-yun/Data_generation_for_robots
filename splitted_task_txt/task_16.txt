### Task:
Stack the three paper cups in a vertical line on the right side of the table.

### Description:
The task involves stacking three paper cups labeled 1, 2, and 3 into a vertical column on the right side of the table. The initial state shows the cups spread out, while the final state shows them stacked vertically. The robot arm needs to pick up each cup sequentially and place it on top of the previous one until all three are stacked.

### Plan:
1. Pick up cup 1 and place it on the table.
2. Pick up cup 2 and place it on top of cup 1.
3. Pick up cup 3 and place it on top of cup 2.

### PLANNING_reason:
The plan starts with picking up the first cup because it's the base for the stack. Then, the second cup is placed on top of the first, and finally, the third cup is added on top of the second, ensuring a vertical stack.

### Step 1
[Step 1]
<SUBTASK> Pick up cup 1.
<SUBTASK_reason> Cup 1 is the starting point for the stack, so it needs to be picked up first.
<MOVE> Move to the left side of the table, pick up cup 1, and place it on the table.
<MOVE_reason> This movement is necessary to move the robot arm to the position where cup 1 can be picked up.
<ISSUE> The robot arm might collide with other objects if it moves too close to the edge of the table.
<SOLUTION> Ensure the robot arm moves slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.

### Step 2
[Step 2]
<SUBTASK> Pick up cup 2.
<SUBTASK_reason> Cup 2 needs to be picked up next to continue the stack.
<MOVE> Move to the center of the table, pick up cup 2, and place it on top of cup 1.
<MOVE_reason> This movement is necessary to move the robot arm to the position where cup 2 can be picked up and placed on top of cup 1.
<ISSUE> The robot arm might collide with the table surface when placing cup 2 on top of cup 1.
<SOLUTION> Ensure the robot arm moves slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.

### Step 3
[Step 3]
<SUBTASK> Pick up cup 3.
<SUBTASK_reason> Cup 3 needs to be picked up last to complete the stack.
<MOVE> Move to the right side of the table, pick up cup 3, and place it on top of cup 2.
<MOVE_reason> This movement is necessary to move the robot arm to the position where cup 3 can be picked up and placed on top of cup 2.
<ISSUE> The robot arm might collide with the table surface when placing cup 3 on top of cup 2.
<SOLUTION> Ensure the robot arm moves slowly and carefully to avoid collisions.
